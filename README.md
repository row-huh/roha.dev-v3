In v3, I was going for a modern tech + dystopian punk vibe and my lack of art skills came up with this;
- Used NextJs + Typescript for both the frontend and the backend of the website
- moreover, I was trying to implement a chatbot with site knowledge and tool calls. In such it is able to answer most questions and can guide across the website
- there was, however, one teeny tiny smol problem : I was running gemini on free tier and inevitably i *did* run out of it.
- my lack of finance couldn't afford to run another expense, i already pay for the domain but i do host for free on vercel and um  _Y E A_
